<h1> Man Dies Three Times </h1>
<h4> in One Night </h4>
<h1> Three Bodies In Hotel. </h1>
<h1> Each Man </h1>
<h4> Carries Same Identity. </h4>
<h2>Three slain men were discovered last night in a London hotel, each bearing positive identification as Mr. Mehmet Makryat, of Islington. Each had been stabbed through the heart. Maids at the Chelsea Arms Hotel discovered the remains. The room also was registered in the name of Mr. Makryat. Bona fide papers identify the trio as one man, the Mr. Makryat who is a Turkish antique and art dealer doing business in this city. The victims bear superficial resemblances, and each had passed as Mr. Makryat since independently arriving in London three days ago. Confusingly, the real Mr. Makryat, or at least the man described by neighboring shopkeepers as Mr. Makryat, cannot be found. Police request that he come forth. The passports of these Turkish nationals record independent world-wide travels for each man over the past three years. Inspector Fleming of Scotland Yard is at a loss to describe the meaning of the bizarre mystery, but is eager to converse with any other Mehmet Makryats still living. </h2>

<h3>Come at once. I haven't long. For god's sake let no one follow you. J.A. Smith. </h3>
<p>Professor Julius Arthur Smith, Litt.D., Ph.D., is 59, a heavy-set Englishman, a scholar who now devotes himself entirely to research. He is famed for his whiskers and great curling moustaches that give him the air of a friendly walrus. His disgusting preferences in tobaccos (especially his favorite, a foul, obsidian-hued Balkan Sobranje), his erudite after-dinner stories, and his hearty laugh are trademarks.

Dr. Smith has lived and traveled extensively on the Continent, His specialties are European languages and archaeology; his Litt.D. was conferred by the University of Vienna. In the past, he has aided many, possibly some of you, in rendering difficult translations. Now his attention has shifted to matters parapsychological, with excellent result.

The professor maintains a town house in St. John's Wood, where he resides when in London. At present it is undergoing renovation, to enlarge his library, and so the investigators must stay at a hotel.

When in London, Smith spends most of his time lecturing at the University of London or reading at the British Museum library. He is a member at the Oriental Club, but does not get there as often as he would like. His country home is an estate not far from Cambridge. Margaret, his wife, died in 1919. These days his manservant Beddows, who is at once friend, assistant, and confidant, is his only companion.<p/>
<p>
<p>If you seek to help this old friend, you would be served well by a sharp wit, a silver tounge and an iron will. Or perhaps the trials that await you would be better dealt with by gun or blade.</p>
